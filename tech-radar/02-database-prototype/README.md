# Tech Radar Database version

Open the base folder in VSCode for the code.

- `corepack enable`
- `pnpm i`
- `cp .env.example .env` Look at inside the file.
- `pnpm run start`

If the browser doesn't open automatically when you run the last command, surf to http://localhost:3000/

This is not meant to work without user interference. We are missing a database and all the stuff inside it.

There is a `secrets` directory that holds the teacher's secret's / an initial example implementation / other stuff, but you are suggested NOT to go there unless you really need to.
